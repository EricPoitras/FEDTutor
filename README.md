What does the hint check?
According to the Nu Html checker documentation, the positive cases contain two sections:

Markup cases that are potential problems for accessibility, usability, compatibility, security, or maintainability—or because they can result in poor performance, or that might cause your scripts to fail in ways that are hard to troubleshoot.

Markup cases that are defined as errors because they can cause you to run into potential problems in HTML parsing and error-handling behavior—so that, say, you’d end up with some unintuitive, unexpected result in the DOM.

For explanation behind those requirements, please check out:
